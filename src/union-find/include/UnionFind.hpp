 * The {@code UnionFind} class represents a

 * It supports the @em associate and @em find operations,
 * along with a @em connected operation for determining whether
 * two sites are in the same component and a @em count operation that
 * returns the total number of components.
 *
 * This implementation uses weighted quick union with full path
 * compression and has next cost model:
 *  - initalize: N
 *  - union: lg N (includes cost of finding root)
 *  - find: lg N
 *
 * Worst-case time: N + M x lg* N (M union-find operations on a set of
 * N objects) and lg* is iterated logarithm.
