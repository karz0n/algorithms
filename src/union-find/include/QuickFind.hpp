/**
 * The {@code QuickFind} class represents a <em>unionâ€“find data type</em>
 * (also known as the <em>disjoint-sets data type</em>).
 * It supports the @em associate and @em find operations,
 * along with a @em connected operation for determining whether
 * two sites are in the same component and a @em count operation that
 * returns the total number of components.
 *
 * This implementation uses quick find with next cost model:
 *  - initialize: N
 *  - union: N
 *  + find: 1 (constantly)
 *
 * Defects:
 *  * union operation too expensive.
 *  * tree are flat, but too expensive too keep them flat.
 *
 * Takes N^2 array accesses to process sequence of N union commands
 * of N objects.
 * Worst-case time: M x N (M union-find operations on a set of N objects).
